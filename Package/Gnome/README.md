# Gnome

GNOME (GNU Network Object Model Environment, pronounced gah-NOHM) is a graphical user interface (GUI) and set of computer desktop applications for users of the Linux operating system. It's intended to make a Linux operating system easy to use for non-programmers and generally corresponds to the Windows desktop interface and its most common set of applications. In fact, GNOME allows the user to select one of several desktop appearances. With GNOME, the user interface can, for example, be made to look like Windows or like Mac OS. In addition, GNOME includes a set of the same type of applications found in Microsoft Office: a word processor, a spreadsheet program, a database manager, a presentation developer, a Web browser and an email program.
