# Zsh

ZSH, also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

Using theme `powerlevel10k` and plugin `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`,...

This directory will setup the `zsh` tool.

## Getting Started

File `setup.sh` will install `zsh` following:

-  [Install ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)
-  [Install Oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
-  [Powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

## Usage

Run `setup.sh` to install `zsh`:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

Change `zsh` shell theme:
Find `ZSH_THEME` line then you need to enable it in `.zshrc`

```bash
ZSH_THEME="powerlevel10k/powerlevel10k"
```

Change terminal font to `MesloLGS NF Regular`, size 10:

```
Preference > Unnamed > Custom Font
```
