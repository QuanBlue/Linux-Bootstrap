# Zsh

ZSH, also called the Z shell, is an extended version of the Bourne Shell (sh), with plenty of new features, and support for plugins and themes. Since itâ€™s based on the same shell as Bash, ZSH has many of the same features, and switching over is a breeze.

Using theme `powerlevel10k` and plugin `zsh-autosuggestions`, `zsh-syntax-highlighting`,...

This directory will setup the `zsh` tool.

## Getting Started

File `setup.sh` will install `zsh` following:

-  [Install ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH)

-  [Powerlevel10k theme](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)
-  [Spaceship theme](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt)

## Usage
